# MonoStatements.app

This is a tiny app I made to master Swift and mac OS app development. The main purpose of this app is to load a list of your transactions from the Monobank account using API and display them.

To use this app you need to either install it from the [dmg file](https://github.com/OlegWock/MonoStatements.app/releases/latest) or build from the source. To obtain the Monobank API key please visit [this page](https://api.monobank.ua/).

Notable features:

* You can convert transaction amount to USD/EUR/RUB/UAH
* You can check transactions from all accounts
* And you can see and copy **all** details about the particular transaction with double click
