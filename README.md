# MonoStatements.app

This is tiny app I made to master Swift and mac OS app development. Main purpouse of this app is to load list of your transactions from Monobank account using API and display them.

Notable features:

* You can convert transaction amount to USD/EUR/RUB/UAH
* You can check transactions from all acount and not only main one
* And you can see and copy **all** details about particular transaction with double click
